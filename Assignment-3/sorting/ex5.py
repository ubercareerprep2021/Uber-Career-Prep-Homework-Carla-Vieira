Sorting Exercise 5: Peaks and Valleys
In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element that is greater than or equal to the adjacent integers and a "valley" is
an element that is less than or equal to the adjacent integers. For example, in the array [5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6], [8, 6]
are peaks and [5, 2] are valleys. Given an array of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and
valleys.

Example
Input: [5, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [5, 1, 3, 2, 3]

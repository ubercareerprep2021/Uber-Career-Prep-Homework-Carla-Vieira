Searching Exercise 4: Median of Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).. You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

For Example:
nums1 = [1, 2], nums2 = [3, 4]
The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
